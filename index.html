    <h1>The Feel of the Summertime</h1>


    <p>June is here and there is nothimg else like the feeling of the Summer.
    such us, the palm trees, the beautiful bright mornings, children smiling,
     messy homes,barbecues, ice cream days, and so much more!</p>


    <h2>Islamorada hosts a truly unforgettable view</h2>


    <p>Happy hour, the early-evening practice of meeting up with friends over a
    light drink and a snack. These are different opportunities to slow down from
    the day before heading out to dinner. Could anything make happy hour in
    Islamorada even more magical? Yes! Try having your sunset dinner in the
    Sand Bar literally surrounded by the spectacular Islamorada view.</p>


    <h3>Cheers!</h3>

    <p>Every sunset brings an opportunity to enjoy a light drink and create
    unforgettable memories. All your problems will go away when you take a breathe
    and enjoy life here in Islamorada.</p>
